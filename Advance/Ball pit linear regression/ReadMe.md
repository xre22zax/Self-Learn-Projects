** Bouncy Ball Bonanza: A Linear Regression Adventure in Python**

Our Story:

Reggie, the resident mad scientist at a local fast food joint, wants to build the ultimate ball pit. To optimize the bounciness, he's diving into the world of physics with a little help from Python and linear regression! Join us as we build a Python function to find the line that best fits Reggie's bouncy ball data, unraveling the mysteries of bounce height and ball width.

---

** The Mission:**

Error Detectives: Calculate the distance between a point and a line (hint: think triangles!), then measure the total error for a line by summing up its distances from all data points.
Slope & Intercept Safari: Explore a jungle of different slopes and intercepts (m and b values) to find the one that minimizes the total error, uncovering the line of best fit!
Prediction Playground: Armed with the best-fit line, predict the bounce height of any ball Reggie throws in, letting him design the bounciest ball pit the world has ever seen!

** Tools of the Trade:**

Python
Lists & Loops
Arithmetic & Functions
(Optional) Plotting libraries for visualizing the data and regression line
